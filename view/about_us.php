    <h2> Frequently asked Questions: </h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>How long does shipping take?</dt>
            <dd>Well, if you ordered a Panda of any type, it will take as long as it takes</dd>
        <br>
        <dt>Do your Panda's come from China or Mexico?</dt>
            <dd>Well, if you are buying a Panda now, it will come from China. On the rare chance Mexico has a new baby panda, we will offer panda's from Mexico</dd>
        <br>
        <dt>How much time do pandas spend eating?</dt>
            <dd>Giant pandas typically will spend 10-16 hours of their day eating, just like me</dd>
        <br>
        <dt>What do pandas eat?</dt>
            <dd>Bamboo. Duh. But, you need to have two different varieties of bamboo on hand. Panda's require variety in order to get the proper nutrients.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt>Do you sell a variety of Bamboo?</dt>
            <dd>As you learned above, panda's require a variety of bamboo to stay healthy. Our bamboo bundles are crafted with a variety of bamboo types. This makes your life easier because you don't have to worry about whether you panda is getting a good variety or not.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt>What do I do if my Panda eats somehting other than bamboo?</dt>
            <dd>Do not fret. While pandas eat mostly bamboo, their digestive system is actually one of a carnivore, they simply chose the vegetarian life. If a Panda eats meat they will be perfectly fine (theoretically).</dd>
        <br>
        <dt>Should I tell my significant other that I bought a panda?</dt>
            <dd>No. It's better to ask for forgiveness than permission. Eventually they will come around and accept the panda (theoretically) (make sure you have a prenup signed to protect yourself and the panda in the case of divorce). *We do not take responsibility for relationship problems caused by buying a panda.</dd>
